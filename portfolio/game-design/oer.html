	<h2>About this Project:</h2>
		<p>This is a project that I worked on with a group of other students for my game development class.</p> 
	<h2>Premise and Goal: </h2>
		<p> You help Captain Playa escape from Captain One Eye's crew and help lead him escape to his ship. The goal of the game is to try to defeat enough pirates to get enough points to be able to make it past the dock and be able to board your ship. </p>
	<h2>My Role-Sound Designer </h2>
		<p>Selected sound effects </p>
		<p>Edited audio and sound effects with Adobe Audition </p>
		<p>Created looping ambiance and one shot sound cues in Unreal Engine</p>
